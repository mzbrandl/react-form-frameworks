To run the code you need to have NodeJS 10 or higher installed.

To test the code run

```bash
npm install
```
inside the `container` folder and in the `webpart` folder.

Inside the `webpart` folder run:
```bash
npm run watch
```

In a seperate terminal run inside the `container` folder: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

A SharePoint Workbench opens, in which you can add the webpart.
